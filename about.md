title: About
---

I am a Silicon Valley veteran living in Seattle. I do advanced work in databases, massively parallel systems, and algorithmic information theory. Spatial data structures and algorithms are a specialty of mine. Most of the computer science research I do is never published even though it is often embedded in commercial software. This blog will hopefully close that gap a bit.

[SpaceCurve](http://www.spacecurve.com) is a startup I founded in 2009. It is a spatial data platform with the unique ability to continuously ingest, fuse, store, and analyze real-time data sources in a single spatiotemporal context at massive scales. Think of it as a continuously updated and fully analyzable mirror of the physical world constructed from every data source available. Not a visualization but the underlying data model of reality with relationships across sensor and data streams preserved. The entire system was designed from scratch and embodies significant computer science advances at every part of the stack.

I am accessible on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jandrewrogers) and [Email](mailto:andrew@jarbox.org).

The "J" in my name is silent.
